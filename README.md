# Semester-Project
Semester Project - Convenience Store Simulation
 - Please use the updatedtest to access the complete code, the test and updated files are the progressions our group made.

(Using the .txt file) To run the code, our group used the IDE known as Visual Studio Code. You simply put the updatedtest file, and upload it to your IDE, once uploaded to your IDE, you must rename the .txt file to .java or whatever your IDE requires then rename the first main to the name of the file(before the ".java"), and then run the code.

(Using the .java file) To run the code, you can copy the file into your IDE and run through the code to get the prompts. 

You must then click run to run the code, and use your keyboard to type the answers to the questions that it gives you to answer. After answering each question it will go to the next section/give you options to choose items, of which you will then be required to type integers in order to complete the code and to get a complete shopping list.

You will then follow up, answering a series of questions that will be printed out to your screen, the code will go along with you and give you in-depth instructions on what to do, taking you through the simulation. 
Once you are nearing the end it will print out a receipt for you to see what you got and what it will cost you shopping at the Awesome Store.
