Semester Project

To run the code, our group used the IDE known as Visual Studio Code. You simply put the updatedtest file, and upload it to your IDE, once uploaded to your IDE, you must rename the .txt file to .java or whatever your IDE requires then rename the first main to the name of the file(before the ".java"), and then run the code.

You will then follow up, answering a series of questions that will be printed out to your screen, the code will go along with you and give you in-depth instructions on what to do, taking you through the simulation. 

Once you are nearing the end it will print out a receipt for you to see what you got and what it will cost you shopping at the Awesome Store.
